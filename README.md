# MyLocalization1
Localization of simple listview
* The simple list view is constructed to demonstrate the different language support for the single app based on the mobile device language.
* The app shows the list of items in the main screen in the default (English) language.
* The strings that are shown are added in the string.xml file for English language (default) support.
* If our app needs to support other languages then separate string.xml files for all such languages need to be created and such files need to added with the strings 
* This apps main screen when english is the device language

* Other languages supported: Hindi and Kannada.
* If app couldn't support the language that the device is currently running, then the default language (English in our case) will be set for the particular application.
